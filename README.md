# nodephonebook

The project is an application that simulates a phonebook, where users can store contact information including names, phone numbers, and customized photos. Third-party packages like "formidable" have been employed to manage the uploading of images that will be assigned to each contact in a personalized manner. If no photo is added for a contact, a default photo will be automatically assigned. Additionally, the application does not use a traditional database; instead, it stores data in the system cache for enhanced efficiency and simplicity.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone <URL_of_the_repository>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nodephonebook`
3. Install project dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage:

1. Run the application server: `node app.js` or `npm start`
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the local address: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Use the application interface to add or delete contacts from the phonebook.
4. When adding a new contact, you can upload a customized image using the provided form. If no image is provided, a default image will be automatically assigned to the contact.
5. Contact data will be stored in the system cache and will be available for querying and management while the application is running.
